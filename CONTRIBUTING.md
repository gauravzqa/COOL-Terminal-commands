# Contributing

This repository contains general purpose commands which are often used by unix or linux users working on a Terminal. It has been created for beginners and the explanations for various commands have been given keeping that in mind.


### How to contribute

- Create an issue if you thing some command has been wrongly explained.
- If you want to suggest any commands you think are used often enough and should be added to the list, either open an issue specifically mentioning the exact working commands or better create a Pull Request and add it yourself! :smiley: See the next point for guidelines on making Pull Requests.

**Note: To add commands for softwares (such as nmap, MATLAB, gdb etc.), make a new file by the name of <software_name>.md and add commands there.**

- Feel free to make Pull Requests to fix issues or add new commands. For a good PR, please keep the following things in mind while contributing:
    - Add only really useful commands.
    - Don't give combinations of different commands for different use cases(Unless they are usually always used together).
    - If you add any flags to the command, explain what each flag individually does.
    - Don't make your explanations too technical. This repository is for newbies. Example - `touch` command although has a vast usecase, is generally only use to create empty files.(See what the README says about `touch` command.)
    - Maintain the general design pattern of the README file - The size of the heading, the way of explaining commands and the linebreaks between related and unrelated commands.
